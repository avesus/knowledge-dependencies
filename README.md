Making sense of human knowledge: an explicit dependency graph

## A conceptual-behavioral explanation of mathematics, physics,
machine learning

### Is a

### Has a


### Containment
We begin with an empty set Ø. We can also write {} (which is common in some programming languages).

{} is a Ø. {} === Ø. Ø === {}.


A set is either empty,
or contains ("has-a")
If everything is a set, and elements 

## Definitions and interfaces

### Term

### Is-a
Multiple inheritance in mathematics is not an anti-pattern
not only because it resolves the famous diamond problem in OOP
using abstract interface inheritance, but it actually goes far beyond.

Surprising and obscure fact that the language of 
mathematics does not resemble object-oriented or functional programming,
but rather behavioral, subjective, test-driven development kind of thing.

This observation has led to the development of the subjective inheritance
theory, and the corresponding machine learning engine automatically
generating implementations and instantiations.

### Types
Type theory is an attempt to serve as an alternative to set theory.
Although being a very successful foundation for the most of modern computer science
(lambda calculus and programming languages), in modern mathematics,
only first-order predicate logic was proven to be stable, consistent,
and of the mainstream use.

### Type

### Instantiation

### Interface

### Propositional logic
The formal foundation of logic.
Equivalent to Boolean algebra.

### Predicate logic
Based on propositional logic.
Foundation for modern definitions in set theory.

### Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory
Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory formalizes the notion of
a hereditary
well-founded
set,
so that all entities in the universe of discourse are such sets.

### Hereditary set
A hereditary set is a set whose all elements are themselves hereditary sets.
The empty set is a hereditary set (it contains the "emptiness").
#### Examples
A set {Ø} contains one element, the empty set Ø.

A set {Ø, {Ø}} contains two elements:
  the empty set Ø and
  the set {Ø} that contains one element, the empty set Ø.

Note that {} is not a definition of an empty set in mathematics.

### Well-founded set
